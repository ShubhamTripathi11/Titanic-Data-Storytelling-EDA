# Titanic-Data-Storytelling-EDA
This repository contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The project aims to uncover insights into the factors that influenced passengers' survival chances during the Titanic disaster. Through data cleaning, feature analysis, and a variety of visualizations, we explore the relationships between survival and key factors such as gender, age, ticket class, fare, and more.

The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which includes information on over 800 passengers, with features such as:

Survived: Outcome (1 for survival, 0 for death)

Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex: Gender of the passenger

Age: Age of the passenger.

Fare: Amount paid for the ticket

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents or children aboard
